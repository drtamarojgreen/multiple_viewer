## 1. Compilation Timeout

**Issue:** The `g++` compiler is timing out after 400 seconds, even when compiling a trivial "Hello, World"-style `main.cpp`. This prevents any verification of code changes.

**Status:** This appears to be an issue with the sandbox environment or the `run_in_bash_session` tool, not the C++ code itself.

**Diagnostics:**
- The timeout occurs even with a minimal `main.cpp` that has no dependencies on the rest of the project's code.
- This indicates the problem is not with the project's complexity, but with the compilation process itself.
- All attempts to compile any C++ source file have resulted in a timeout.

**Mitigation:**
- Unable to proceed with compilation-dependent tasks. Will need to ask the user for assistance or guidance on how to resolve the environment issue.
